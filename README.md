# MACHINE_LEARNING_WALMART_SALES

## Description

Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

## Goals
The project aims to construct a basic machine learning model for sales prediction while addressing overfitting concerns.

## Dataset
The dataset is called Walmart_Store_sales.csv

## Content
The project is organized into three main parts, each focusing on a specific aspect:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Dataset**
   - Overview of the dataset, including its dimensions and data types.
   - Identification of missing values and consideration of potential implications.
   - Displaying a sample of the dataset and providing basic statistics.

2. **Data Preprocessing, Model Training, and Performance Analysis**
   - Preprocessing the data, which involves handling categorical and numerical values, and performing encoding.
   - Training a linear regression model on the training set.
   - Performance analysis on both the training and test sets using the R2 score.

3. **Feature Importance and Mitigating Overfitting Issues**
   - In-depth exploration of the feature importance within the model to understand the variables driving the predictions.
   - Implementation of regularization techniques, specifically Lasso and Ridge, to address potential overfitting and enhance the model's robustness.
   - Drawing conclusions based on the insights gained from feature importance analysis and regularization results.

## Usage

To utilize and explore this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/Simoncld8/MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJET_WALMART.git


2. **Install Dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt  

3. **Run the Analysis:**

   You will find all the analysis in the Jupyter Notebook provided (`Projet_Walmart.ipynb`).
